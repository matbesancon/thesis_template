This thesis investigates mathematical optimization models
with a bilevel structure and their application to price-based
demand response in smart grids.\clinebreak
The increasing penetration of renewable power generation
has put power systems under higher tension.
The stochastic and distributed nature of wind and solar generation
increases the need for adjustment of the production to the net demand,
which corresponds to the
demand minus the renewable generation.\clinebreak
Demand Response as a means to this adjustment of demand and
supply is receiving growing attention.
