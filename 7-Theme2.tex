\Chapter{OPTIMAL MULTI-USER UNICORN MATCHING}\label{chap:multitlou}

\section*{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This is a very new topic.

\section{Theory}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:limitside}
For a capacity candidate $k \in S$, the value of the capacity has to be finite.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Argument of authority.
\end{proof}

\section{Computational experiments}\label{sec:num-resolution}

This section is mostly here to show the inclusion of a table.
I kept tables separated in the template because they are generated directly
by simulations. They are then copied to the \textit{tables} folder.

\input{tables/stats_predetermined.tex}

\cref{tab:statspredetermined} shows the number
of successfully optimized, infeasible, and timed-out instances for different numbers
of clusters, users, and for the three methods.
