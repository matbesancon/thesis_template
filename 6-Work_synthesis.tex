\Chapter{SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS}\label{chap:WorkSynthesis}

The work presented in this thesis is structured around two aspects.
The first one is the development of a bilevel framework for the optimal
price-setting of a Time-and-Level-of-Use program. The second component is
the development of the concept of near-optimal robustness for bilevel problems.
